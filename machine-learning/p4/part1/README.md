## Part 1

To run K-means five times for each value of K, run the two following commands (each for one image). The compressed images will be saved into part1.

```bash
# Compress Koala image
bash batch-compress.sh Koala.jpg koala-compress

# Compress Penguins image
bash batch-compress.sh Penguins.jpg peng-compress
```

To plot the figures like in my report, use `part1/plot.py` (instructions of cmd arguments are in the code).
